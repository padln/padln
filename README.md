Hello! My name is Nathan and I am a physics and math enthusiast.
I've worked on detecting and characterizing stellar flares at the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy (mira.org) using NASA light curve data.
I currently am an undergrad at UCSB majoring in physics.
I've also worked on underwater robotics through X-academy (xacademy.org). In 2021 my robotics team came in 7th internationally at the MATE ROV competition.
